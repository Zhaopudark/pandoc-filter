# pandoc-filter

This project supports some useful and highly customized [pandoc python filters](https://pandoc.org/filters.html) that based on [panflute](http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/). They can meet some special requests when using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to

- [x] convert files from `markdown` to `gfm`
- [x] convert files from `markdown` to `html`
- [ ] convert other formats (In the future)

Please see [Main Features](#main-features) for the concrete features.

Please see [Samples](#Samples) for the recommend usage.

# Backgrounds

I'm used to taking notes with markdown and clean markdown syntax. Then, I usually post these notes on [my site](https://little-train.com/) as web pages. So, I need to convert markdown to html. There were many tools to achieve the converting and  I chose [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) at last due to its powerful features.

But sometimes, I need many more features when converting from `markdown` to `html`, where pandoc filters are needed. I have written some pandoc python filters with some advanced features by [panflute](https://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute) and many other tools. And now, I think it's time to gather these filters into a combined toolset as this project. 

# Installation

```
pip install -i https://pypi.org/simple/ -U pandoc-filter
```

# Main Features

There are 2 supported ways:

-  **command-line-mode**: use non-parametric filters in command-lines with [pandoc](https://pandoc.org).
- **python-mode**: use `run_filters_pyio`  function in python.

For an example, `md2md_enhance_equation_filter` in [enhance_equation.py](https://github.com/Zhaopudark/pandoc-filter/blob/main/src/pandoc_filter/filters/md2md/enhance_equation.py) is a filter function as [panflute-user-guide ](http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/guide.html). And its registered command-line script is `md2md-enhance-equation-filter`. 

- So, after the installation, one can use it in **command-line-mode**:

  ```powershell
  pandoc ./input.md -o ./output.md -f markdown -t gfm -s --filter md2md-enhance-equation-filter
  ```

- Or, use in **python mode**

  ```python
  import pandoc_filter
  file_path = pathlib.Path("./input.md")
  output_path = pathlib.Path("./output.md")
  pandoc_filter.run_filters_pyio(file_path,output_path,'markdown','gfm',[pandoc_filter.md2md_enhance_equation_filter])
  ```

**Runtime status** can be recorded. In **python mode**, any filter function will return a proposed panflute `Doc`. Some filter functions will add an instance attribute dict `runtime_dict` to the returned `Doc`, as a record for **runtime status**, which may be very useful for advanced users.  For an example,  `md2md_enhance_equation_filter`, will add an instance attribute dict `runtime_dict` to the returned `Doc`, which may contain a mapping `{'math':True}` if there is any math element in the `Doc`.

All filters with corresponding  registered command-line scripts, the specific features, and the recorded **runtime status** are recorded in the following table:

> [!NOTE]
>
> Since some filters need additional arguments, not all filter functions support **command-line-mode**, even though they all support **python-mode** indeed.
>
> All filters support cascaded invoking.
