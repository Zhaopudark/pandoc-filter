## Release 0.1.0b0
Begin to use semantic version control formally. For this project:
- We consider CI tests as alpha tests. So there is no alpha release.
- Use `z.y.0bn` as the pre-release (beta release) version number.
- Use `z.y.0` as the normal release version number.
- Use `z.y.n`, where `n > 0`, as the patch release version number.
